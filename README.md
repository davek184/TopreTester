# TopreTester
Simple Topre Switch Tester
---
Non fuctional topre switch tester. Used to test lubing techniques and different domes/mods.

Files
---
 * *FR4* - Note should be 1.2mm thick (not default 1.6mm)
 * *DXF* - Files for lazer and other material cutting (note m3 screws and optionally standoffs should be used)
 * *STL* - 3d print files (note m3 screws and optionally standoffs should be used)

Notes
---
Requires some filing of the plate to ensure a tight but not too tight fit around the topre housing taps. Simple model file or nail file will do just needs a little bit of material removed

Special thank you for [Cipulot](https://github.com/cipulot) for creating the topre switch footprints.
