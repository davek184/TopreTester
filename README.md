For FR4 Using [Solder studs](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/3256803132678460.html) to secure m3 screws to plate

Notes
---
* Requires some filing of the plate to ensure a tight but not too tight fit around the topre housing taps. Simple model file or nail file will do just needs a little bit of material removed
* For FR4 Version break apart plate and PCB sections by hand (use sandpaper to clean up edges)
